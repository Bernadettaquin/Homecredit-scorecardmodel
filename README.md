Project Overview:

This project develops a credit score prediction model for Home Credit. The model aims to ensure that customers with the ability to repay are not rejected during the loan application process. It also helps structure loans with a clear principal, maturity, and repayment schedule. By leveraging machine learning, this project provides insights into customer creditworthiness and improves the decision-making process for loan approvals.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost / LightGBM (for modeling)

Objectives:

Predict the creditworthiness of customers using historical data, minimize the rejection of reliable borrowers and to support responsible lending decisions by providing a scorecard model.

Key Steps:

1. Data preprocessing and handling missing values.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for customer insights.

3. Feature selection and engineering.

4. Model training and evaluation with multiple algorithms.

5. Interpretation of feature importance and business recommendations.

Expected Outcomes:

- Improved loan approval accuracy.

- Reduced default risks.

- Fairer access to credit for customers.
